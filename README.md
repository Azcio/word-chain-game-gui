# word-chain-game-gui
A fun, interactive word puzzle game built in Python with a Tkinter GUI, inspired by games like Wordle but with a unique twist.  In this game, you complete a chain of connected words, where each word leads to the next. You‚Äôll need logic, vocabulary, and a bit of luck to succeed

**How the Game Works**

The game starts with a word chain (e.g., golf ‚Üí club ‚Üí card ‚Üí game).
The first word is revealed, and you must guess each following word, letter by letter.
You type letters into boxes (like Wordle style).
**Normal Mode:**
You get 3 attempts per word.
You can use hints (reveals letters) at a cost of points.
Points per correct word: 100 max, minus 10 per hint.
No points if all letters are revealed by hints.
Bonus: +50 points if you complete the entire chain without mistakes.

**Hard Mode:**
No hints, no retries.
One mistake resets the entire chain with a new one.

**Features**
Clean Tkinter GUI with a grid-based interface (similar to Wordle).
Real-time feedback:
‚úÖ Green for correct words.
üü® Yellow for hinted letters.
‚ùå Red when attempts are used up.
Session scoring + total score across multiple games.
Two difficulty modes: Normal & Hard.
Scrollable game area for long word chains.
Option to return to the main menu.

**Skills & Technologies**
This project highlights:
Python 3
Tkinter (GUI development, grid layouts, scrollable frames)
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) for clean game logic
Game logic design: word chains, hint system, scoring system, difficulty modes
Problem solving & debugging complex state management
Git & GitHub for version control

**Run Game GUI**
